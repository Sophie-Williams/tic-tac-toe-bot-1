# Tic-Tac-Toe Bot

This is an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe playing bot that will always lead the game to either a draw, or the bot winning.

This bot uses principles of [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), particularly the [Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to achieve this. On every turn, the program will construct a [Game Tree](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yosenl/extras/alphabeta/alphabeta.html) and evaluate what the optimal path is. It will choose the most highly-evaluated path to determine where to play next.
